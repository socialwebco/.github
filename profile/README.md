# Social Web Collective

We are a collective of people building the world-wide Social Web.

Our mission is to support ever-increasing interoperability between the [pluriverse](https://newpublic.substack.com/p/a-social-network-taxonomy) of social applications on the world wide web.

We build towards cross-platform interop by coordinating and aligning our efforts.

## Relation to 'Social Web *Foundation*'

No relation, other than a high degree of mission-alignment.

ActivityPub powers significant parts of the social web and with the backing of institutions like the SWF it can continue to evolve.

## Donations

As an unregistered & grassroots rganisation we are not yet able to accept donations on behalf of our members. However, we will gladly help direct charitable donors of Social Web initiatives to individuals eligible to receive monetary support.

Do note however thay we will only accept/mediate funds on completely transparent (publicly viewable) terms.

Contact us (soon) for more.

## Pending Specifications

We are scouting and will readily advocate for emerging internet specifications drafted in the spirit of [digital agency](https://github.com/muni-town/agentic-fediverse).
