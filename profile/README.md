# Social Web Collective

We are a collective of people building the world-wide Social Web.

Our mission is to support ever-increasing interoperability between the [pluriverse](https://newpublic.substack.com/p/a-social-network-taxonomy) of social applications on the world wide web.

We build towards cross-platform interop by coordinating and aligning our efforts.
